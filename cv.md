## About Me

---

I've always been attracted to the technical sciences. By education, I am an energy engineer and economist. I worked in an international transport company, a leader in the European freight market.
In 2014 I opened my advertising agency. It had closing in 2021.
My interest in IT began with learning Linux. Slowly I switched to learning HTML and CSS. I decided for myself that I wanted to develop in this direction. It allows me to work for the outside market from anywhere in the world where there is the internet.

My strengths:

- Quick learning curve
- Hard work
- Team play
- Delegation
- Assiduity and learnability
- I find it easy to communication large customers
- I try to develop 1-2 new skills per year
